# bioinformatic_master_projects
This repository contains scripts / notebooks I used for projects during my formation as a bioinformatician. 

For each project, you can find instructions to launch the notebooks / scripts inside them or in the README.md file. 

I would like to thank the participants to all these projects (informations on the specific README.md files) for their involvement and for giving me their permission to publish this repository.
